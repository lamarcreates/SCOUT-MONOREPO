## Pre-Push Checklist

**MANDATORY**: Before pushing any code changes to the repository, complete ALL of the following steps:

1. **Test Locally**
   - Run `npm run dev:frontend` and verify functionality works
   - Test the specific features/changes you've made
   - Check browser console for any errors

2. **Build Verification**
   - Run `npm run build:frontend` to ensure NX build passes
   - Run `npx vercel build` to ensure Vercel build passes locally
   - Address any build errors or warnings before proceeding

3. **Code Quality**
   - Run `npm run lint` if available
   - Ensure no TypeScript errors are present
   - Check that all imports are correct (especially for AI SDK v5)

4. **API Testing** (if applicable)
   - Test API endpoints with curl or browser
   - Verify responses are in correct format
   - Check error handling works properly

5. **Final Verification**
   - Review all changed files with `git diff`
   - Ensure no sensitive data (API keys, secrets) are committed
   - Verify commit message is clear and descriptive

Only after ALL checks pass should you run:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Clear descriptive message"
git push origin main
```
