# Quick Start Deployment Guide

## Simplest Path to Production

### Phase 1: Frontend Only (This Week)
1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd scout-workspace
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   # Create repo on GitHub
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Import your repository
   - It auto-detects NX + Next.js
   - Click Deploy
   - ✅ Frontend is live!

### Phase 2: Simple Backend (Next Week)
**Option A: Use Vercel Functions (Easiest)**
- Create API routes in Next.js `/app/api/`
- Vercel handles everything
- No AWS needed initially
- Free tier: 100GB bandwidth

**Option B: Single EC2 Instance**
- One t3.micro instance
- Runs your Fastify backend
- ~$0 first year (free tier)
- Simple to understand and debug

### Phase 3: Scale Later (When Needed)
- Add RDS database
- Add Redis for caching  
- Add CloudFront CDN
- Consider Lambda if traffic is spiky

## Today's Action Items

1. **Create GitHub Repo** (10 mins)
2. **Sign up for Vercel** (5 mins)
3. **Deploy Frontend** (5 mins)
4. **Sign up for AWS** (10 mins) - but don't launch anything yet

## Which Backend Approach?

### For Learning/Control → EC2
- You SSH in and control everything
- Like having your own Linux server
- Better for learning AWS

### For Simplicity → Vercel API Routes
- Write backend code in `/app/api/`
- No AWS needed initially
- Can migrate later

### For "Proper" Architecture → Lambda
- More complex setup
- Better for production scale
- Overkill for MVP

## My Recommendation

1. **Today**: Deploy frontend to Vercel via GitHub
2. **This Week**: Start with Vercel API routes for backend
3. **Next Month**: Move backend to EC2 when you need more control
4. **Future**: Consider Lambda when you have real traffic

This gets you live TODAY with zero AWS complexity!
